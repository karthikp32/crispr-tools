Sales Agent Design: 

The Sales Agent for CRISPR Tools will be broken down into Lead Finding Agent and Lead Emailing Agent. I will try to implement these functionalities through a single Sales Agent first.

Core Components: 

1) Model 

2) Tools

3) Instructions

4) Guardrails

Lead Finding Agent Routine:
1) Prompt GPTâ€‘4o-mini or another models finds 50 gene editing researchers or professionals with similar jobs across academia, biotech, and startups.
2) Use a model to evaluate and verify these are people who would actually find https://www.crispr-tools.com/ useful
3) Find the emails of these people
4) Verify these emails are valid using a service like MailTester
5) Add Name,	Org,	Role,	Email,	Status, of new people to spreadsheets

Lead Emailing Agent Routine:
6) Figure out which people have not been emailed yet
7) Prompt a model to generate personalized email for each individual
8) Send emails in batches from contact@crispr-tools.com email
9) Update Status in Spreadsheet
