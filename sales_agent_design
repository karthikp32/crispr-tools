Sales Agent Design: 

The Sales Agent for CRISPR Tools will be broken down into Lead Finding Agent and Lead Emailing Agent. I will try to implement these functionalities through a single Sales Agent first.

Core Components: 

1) Model 

2) Tools

3) Instructions

4) Guardrails
Validate that each personalized email is safe, professional, and doesn't have any inappropriate content.

Lead Finding Agent Routine:
1) Prompt GPTâ€‘4o-mini or another models finds 50 gene editing researchers or professionals with similar jobs across academia, biotech, and startups.
2) Use a model to evaluate and verify these are people who would actually find https://www.crispr-tools.com/ useful. Also use free tier of Hunter.io.
3) Find the emails of these people. Go to website of where these people work and look at About pages and Contact pages to figure out the email
4) Verify these emails are valid using a service like MailTester
5) Add Name,	Org,	Role,	Email,	Status, of new people to spreadsheets

7) Prompt a model to generate personalized email for each individual
8) Ensure that guardrails checks that each personalized email is safe, professional, and doesn't have any inappropriate content.
