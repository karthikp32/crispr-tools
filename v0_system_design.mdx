Goal:
Create a website that allows CRISPR researchers to find the right tools for their needs quickly.

Scope and Requirements:
- Functional Requirements:
  - Users can view a list of curated CRISPR tools
  - Users can filter tools by purpose and species
  - Users can see summary of each CRISPR tool
  - Users can click external link of each CRISPR tool
- Non-Functional Requirements
  - Filtering should take 0-100 ms
  - External link button click should take <= 50 ms
  - 99% reliability
  - Assume 2 filters per user per day for about 200 filters per day
  - Reliability and latency should be met for variables amount of filters
  - List of tools, their summaries, and other metadata should updated nightly
