Goal:
Create a website that allows CRISPR researchers to find the right tools for their needs quickly.

Scope and Requirements:
- Let's build for 100 users that search across tools for their needs 2x a day
- Assume 2 searches per user and 2 filters per user per day for about 200 searches and 200 filters per day
- Aim for 99% reliability
- Searching for tools should take 0-100 ms
- Filtering should take 0-100 ms
- External link button click should take <= 50 ms
- List of tools, their summaries, and other metadata should updated nightly

Capacity Estimation and Constraints:
