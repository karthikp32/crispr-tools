# 🚀 CRISPR Sales Agent Implementation Plan

> **Strategy:** Modular component architecture for parallel development and easy maintenance

## 1. 🏗️ Why Isolating Components Works

Each component (Lead Finding, Emailing, Guardrails, etc.) has its own **responsibilities and data flows**.

### Benefits of Component Isolation:

- ✅ **Avoid merge conflicts** between agents
- ✅ **Test and debug components independently**
- ✅ **Reduce risk of "state bleed"** (one agent overwriting another's logic)
- ✅ **Allow parallel development**, speeding up iteration

## 2. 📁 Suggested File/Component Structure

```bash
crispr_sales_agent/
│
├── lead_finding.py      # Scraping, GPT prompts for lead discovery
├── lead_verification.py # Relevance scoring, email validation
├── email_drafting.py    # Personalized email generation with guardrails
├── email_sending.py     # Gmail API batching and sending
├── crm_integration.py   # Google Sheets read/write
├── utils.py             # Shared helpers: logging, formatting, API calls
└── main.py              # Orchestrates the full workflow
```

## 3. 🤖 How Multiple Coding Agents Can Work

### 🎯 Agent Assignment Strategy

Assign **one agent per component file**:

| Agent | Component | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Agent A** | `lead_finding.py` | Lead discovery & scraping |
| **Agent B** | `email_drafting.py` | Personalized email generation |
| **Agent C** | `email_sending.py` | Gmail API integration |

### 🔌 Clear Component Interfaces

**Input/output formats:** JSON, dict, CSV

**Example Flow:**
```json
lead_finding.py outputs JSON list of leads 
    ↓
email_drafting.py reads JSON → adds emails
    ↓
email_sending.py processes final emails
```

### ⚡ Parallel Implementation

- **Independent Development:** Each coding agent develops and tests its component independently
- **Mock Data Usage:** Can use mock data for inputs while other components are in progress
- **Isolated Testing:** Components can be tested individually with testing scripts before integration

### 🔄 Integration / Orchestration

**`main.py`** imports all component files and sequentially executes:

```python
Lead Finding → Verification → Draft → Send → Update CRM
```

**Testing Strategy:** Each component tested individually before integration

## 4. 🎯 Advantages of This Approach

### 🚀 Key Benefits

- **⚡ Faster iteration:** Agents can work in parallel
- **🐛 Easier debugging:** Isolate bugs to a single file/component
- **🔧 Flexible updates:** Swap models, prompts, or APIs in one component without breaking the rest
- **🧪 Safe experimentation:** Test new GPT prompts for email drafting without touching lead discovery

### 📊 Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Components | Duration | Parallel Work |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Phase 1** | Lead Finding + Verification | 2-3 days | ✅ Yes |
| **Phase 2** | Email Drafting + Sending | 2-3 days | ✅ Yes |
| **Phase 3** | CRM Integration + Utils | 1-2 days | ✅ Yes |
| **Phase 4** | Integration + Testing | 1-2 days | ❌ Sequential |

### 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

- **Component isolation** prevents cascade failures
- **Mock data** enables early testing
- **Clear interfaces** ensure smooth integration
- **Independent testing** catches issues early
